        <span class="testimonial1__span">I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned were current, if not more so, 
        in the company I joined. I honestly feel I got every penny’s worth.</span><br><br>
         <span class="span-paragraphs">“ I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I’ve been looking to make a 
         transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up 
         for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. 
         The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing 
         the course, I’ve successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup. ”</span></p>

            <span class="span-paragraphs">“ Before joining the bootcamp, I’ve never written a line of code. Ineeded some structure from 
        professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former 
        student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff 
        did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team 
        project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial 
        could ever have. In fact, I’ve often referred to it during interviews as an example of my developent 
        experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers. 
        100% recommend! ”</span></p>
